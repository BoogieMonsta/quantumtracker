# QuickTracker
A keyboard operated tracker sequencer made with Vue 3 and Elementary Audio.

This is a work in progress, most major features are still missing, as I'm still ironing out basic bugs.

The idea is that eventually, the user can program, play, stop and edit sequences of kicks, snares, hihats and additional samples without ever lifting their fingers off their keyboards.

For now, one can click steps, then either click on the "QuickTracker" logo, or press the 'space' bar to start/stop the audio. There's also a basic slider in place to be able to change the tempo, but a better implementation is on the way.
